## üì£ Commands

The following commands are available from the root of the project:

```shell
# Builds the app for production
build

# Compiles Tailwind styles into a CSS file
build:tailwind

# Starts the development server
dev

# Runs ESLint rules
lint

# Runs the production build and serves the app
start
```

## üíª Installing

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> Note: This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager.
> Do not use `npm` or `yarn` as this will generate duplicate lockfiles and may lead to unexpected behavior for other developers.

Install the dependencies with the following command:

```shell
pnpm install
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Getting Started

### Environment variables
Once the dependencies are installed, you will need to create a `.env` file before you can begin development.

Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then you will need to fill in the corresponding values for the environment variables in the `.env` file.


### Starting the development server
From there you can start the development server with the following command from the root of the repo:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

## üì¶ Building for production

You can build the project with the following command from the root of the repo:

```shell
pnpm build
```

This will generate a `.next` folder with the compiled files.
Then you can serve up the production build locally or in a deployed environment using this command:

```shell
pnpm start
```
